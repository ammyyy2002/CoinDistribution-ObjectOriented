"# CoinDistribution-ObjectOriented" 

A given set of coins with different valence and frequency is to be divided among a given number of n sets 
in such a way that all n sets are of equal value. 
If such a solution cannot be found, this is also output.
This has to be done in an object oriented and recursive way, where no (pseudo)attributes are used!
